-- 000018_add_automation_workflows.sql
-- Introduces automation workflows: a project-scoped, draft/active/archived
-- dependency graph over existing tasks. Nodes just wrap a task (position on
-- the canvas). Edges are plain dependency links (source node -> target node)
-- with no per-edge configuration. Status->assignee rules live on the
-- WORKFLOW (not the node) — one shared list per workflow, applied uniformly
-- to whichever task/node currently has that status — and are reused by both
-- automation events. The workflow also has a status-transition chain
-- (workflow_status_transitions): for each project status, an optional
-- "next status." The workflow's done status is DERIVED from this chain —
-- whichever status has no next status configured — rather than being a
-- separate per-node field (see docs/architecture/automation-workflows.md
-- for full semantics).

-- Grant the new workflows.read/workflows.write permissions to existing

--   - PROJECT_OWNER / PROJECT_MANAGER / PROJECT_MEMBER / PROJECT_VIEWER are
--     the global role *templates* (project_id IS NULL) from
--     authz.DefaultProjectRoles() — kept in sync here defensively, though
--     bootstrap's seedDefaultProjectRoleTemplates already re-syncs them
--     on every startup.
--   - Admin / Editor / Viewer are the actual per-project roles seeded by
--     projectsvc.CreateProject for every project; that codepath has its own
--     hardcoded permission maps (not sourced from DefaultProjectRoles()) and
--     is never re-synced after project creation, so those rows need this
--     backfill too.
--
-- The JSONB `||` merge only adds/overwrites the listed keys, so any other
-- permission a project admin already customised on these rows is preserved.
-- Role renames after creation mean this name-based match isn't 100%
-- precise, but it's the same signal the application code itself uses to
-- identify these roles (see RoleName == "Admin" in projectsvc.CreateProject).
